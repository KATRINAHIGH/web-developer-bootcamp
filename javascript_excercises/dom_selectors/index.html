       <h1>DOM Selectors</h1>
       <ul>
           <li>DOM..need to remember that all of our elements live inside the document
               object. Document object is the top level or root node.
           </li>
           <li>OPen up browser window and type the following in the console: document.URL;
               document.head; document.body; document.links;
           </li>
           <li>All the selectors. All the methods we are going to learn live inside the 
               document. Everything we will learn in this section will start with document.___something
           </li>
           <li>Methods, Five main methods will be learning. These five methods 
               have all been add into the document object. Refer to catSpace and dogSpace
                where we created an object with 2 different methods inside of it</li>
           <ul>
               <li>document.getElementById() <br>
            Takes a string argument and returns the one element with a matching ID
            When entering var tag = document.getElementById("highlight"); into the browser
            console and then entering tag on the next line. The tag is returned to us
            as text but it is actually an object. console.dir(tag) will return object</li>
               <li>document.getElementsByClassName()<br>
            Takes a string argument and returns a list of elements that have a 
            matching class. Returns all elements with that class name. In our case it's 2
            but it could be thousands. Technically, it doesn't return an array. It returns
            a node list which is array like. It's a lightweight array. It comes with some of the 
            features of an array but some of th advance things are missing. We can access
            elements using index. We can do tags.length. But we can't do a foreach loop!! Behind
            the scenes its actually an object.</li>
               <li>document.getElementsByTagName<br>
            Returns a list of all elements of a given tag name like li or h1 
            Not limited to tags inside body. Could use body tag and will return list with 
            one body tag inside of it. Could do it for head, html element, or title. 
            Even if only one element will return it in a list</li>
               <li>document.querySelector()<br>
            Returns the first element that matches a given CSS-style selector. By CSS
            stle selector we mean any of the selectors we can use inside a CSS document.
            We can replicate all getElementBy selectors with querySelector. Can't write
            the word "highlight" for the id like we did in getElementById. We must use the 
            CSS syntax "#highlight". Will only return the first element we looking for. 
            ".bolded" will only return the first element with that selector and not a list. Sometimes this
            is useful. For instance, if used getElementByTag for body returns a list but querySelector
            returns the object.<br>
            Can get more specific. Can select anchor tag with a class special inside of an li</li>
               <li>document.querySelectorall()<br>
            Returns a list of elements that matches a given CSS-style selector. Can still
            use if only one element you are looking for.</li>
