       <h1>Scope</h1>
       <p>Scope is the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects in some 
           particular part of your code during runtime. In other words, scope 
           determines the visibility of variables and other resources in areas of
            your code.</p>
        <h2>In the JavaScript language there are two types of scopes:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Global Scope, Variables defined inside a function. Each function when invoked creates a new scope.</li>
            <li>Local Scope, variables defined outside of a function</li>
        </ul>
