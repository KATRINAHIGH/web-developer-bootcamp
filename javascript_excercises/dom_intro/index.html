       <h1>DOM</h1>
       <ul>
           <li>Define what DOM is. Document Object Model. The document object Model
               is the interface between your javascript and HTML+CSS. Javascript methods
               and functions we can use to interact with our HTML and CSS.<br>
               The browser turns every HTML tag into a javascript object that we can manipulate. 
               Everything is stored inside of the document object.<br>
               Type the following in the browser to see whats going on under the hood.
               document //will just return html
               console.dir(document); //will print out page in object syntax
               object model part of DOM tells us that it's a  bunch of javascript objects that are 
               modelling objects in our html. We have an a tag in our html. We end up with an object 
               representing that a tag.
               It's called the Document OM because everything lives inside one object called the document

           <li>Understand why DOM manipulation is awesome<br>
            Games, Scrolling effects, dropdown menus, form validations, interactivity,
            animations, every awesome site ever
           </li>
           <li>List a few examples of sites that use JS to manipulate the DOM</li>

       <h1>Manipulating the DOM</h1>
       <ul>
           <li>Select an Element then manipulate</li>
           <ul>
               <li>Example we will change the color of an h1 tag using JS.
                   Select the h1 tag and save it to a variable. querySelector returns
                   an object that represents the h1 and saves it in a variable. Now that
                   we have the element selected we can manipulate it. Next line start with
                   element variable just named and manipulate the style which is a property
                   with the nested property of color.
               </li>
               <li>Selection:   var h1 = document.querySelector("h1");</li>
               <li>Manipulate:  h1.style.color = "pink";</li>
           </ul>
           <li>One More Example</li>
           <ul>
               <li>select the body and change it's color every second</li>
               <li>Select:   var body = document.querySelector("body"); var isBlue = false;</li>
               <li>Manipulate: 
                   setInterval(function(){
                if(isBlue){
                    body.style.background = "white";
                } else {
                    body.style.background = "#3498db";
                }
                isBlue = !isBlue;
            }, 1000);</li>
            <li>SetInterval takes 2 arguments. The first is the code to run and the second 
                is the time in milliseconds at which to run the code.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <li>I had an uncaught type error that was resolved by loading the javascript at the bottom
               of the page instead of the header.
           </li>
       </ul>
