/**An array is a type of data structure that stores elements of the same type in 
a contiguous block of memory. In an array each memory location has a unique index
that can be referenced.*/

Given an array, of integers print each element in reverse order as a single line 
of space-separated integers.
Print all  integers in  in reverse order as a single line of space-separated integers.

 function reverseArray(arr){
            var result = "";
            for(var i = arr.length()-1; i > 0; i++){
                result += arr[1] + " ";
            }
            return result;
        }
